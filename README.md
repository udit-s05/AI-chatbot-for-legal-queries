# Law Chatbot Project

This project implements a conversational AI chatbot that can answer legal questions. The chatbot is built on top of a fine-tuned GPT-2 model from Hugging Face Transformers library. It leverages natural language processing to understand and respond to legal queries.

## Features

- **Law-focused conversation**: The model is fine-tuned specifically for legal queries and provides relevant answers based on its training.
- **Interactive chatbot interface**: Users can ask legal questions, and the bot will respond with legal-related answers.
- **Fine-tuned GPT-2 model**: The model is based on GPT-2, a large pre-trained language model, fine-tuned on specific legal data.

## Requirements

To run the chatbot locally, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch (for model inference)
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- An internet connection to download the pre-trained model

### Install Dependencies

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
